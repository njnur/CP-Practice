# CP-Practice

## Overview

This repository is a collection of my personal coding solutions, primarily focused on Competitive Programming (CP), data
structures, and algorithms. It is intended to serve as a resource for others looking to enhance their coding skills and
prepare for competitive programming contests or technical interviews.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into several folders, each dedicated to specific topics or sources of competitive
programming problems. Here's a brief overview:

- **DSA90Days**: Covers fundamental algorithms including Sorting, Searching, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Techniques,
  and more. My personal DSA journey for the 90 days.
- **LeetCode**: Contains solutions to challenges from LeetCode, categorized by topics (Array, String etc.).

## How to Navigate

- To study a particular data structure or algorithm, navigate to the respective folder of LeetCode.
- If you're looking for solutions to specific platforms like LeetCode go directly to those folders.

## Contribution Guidelines

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you'd like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your contributions (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeatureName`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeatureName`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.

Please ensure your code is well-documented and follows the existing structure and naming conventions.
